things I want in my github:
-learning folder with my learning code and page with notes 

questions:
1. what do you call it when you do function(filename:str

2. can you explain the dict structure of the below? if i have just one value per key, how would i write my dict?
3. for the below, is it always good practice to incude if __name__ == '__main__' to establish that you are in the general scope? (is this correct?)
if __name__ == '__main__':
column_lookup = {
    'ds-credit': 'CustomerID CheckingAccountBalance DebtsPaid SavingsAccountBalance CurrentOpenLoanApplications'.split(),
    'ds-app': 'CustomerID LoanPayoffPeriodInMonths LoanReason RequestedAmount InterestRate Co-Applicant'.split(),
    'ds-borrower': 'CustomerID YearsAtCurrentEmployer YearsInCurrentResidence Age RentOrOwnHome TypeOfCurrentEmployment NumberOfDependantsIncludingSelf'.split(),
    'ds-result': 'CustomerID WasTheLoanApproved'.split()
})
